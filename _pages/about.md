I am affiliated with the School of Medicine at the Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen Campus. My research focuses on medical artificial intelligence and computer vision, with a specialized emphasis on medical image segmentation. Our work aims to develop novel and robust intelligent computational models for the accurate segmentation and analysis of multi-modal medical images (such as CT and MRI), providing essential AI tools and methodological support for early disease screening, precise diagnosis, and treatment planning. Through cutting-edge interdisciplinary research integrating computer science and medicine, we hope to contribute to the advancement of smart healthcare.
